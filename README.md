# PHM IEEE 2012 Data Challenge

This is a dataset that was used for the PHM IEEE 2012 Data Challenge. It used to be online at http://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/PHM/IEEE-PHM-2012-Data-challenge.php, but isn't anymore.

The set contains a training set of 6 rolling bearings that were operated in three different conditions, and a testing set of 11 more. See the added PDF file for all the info of the challenge and the set.
